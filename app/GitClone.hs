-- OutLine 
-- Git Protocol: 
-- used for git client to retrieve the required set of changes 
-- from a remote git server using a variety of transport mechanisms

-- Pack File:
-- format used to transfer the minimal amount of data from the server to the client
-- and for effiecnt storage of the packed objects in repository

-- Underlying Object Store:
-- git ised fpr stpre commits, trees, tags,  and the actual file content

-- Index Format:
-- used to track changes to the files in the working directory


-- 1 
-- The Clone Process:
-- Parse the clone url to extract the host, port and repository path information.
-- Connect to the git server via TCP using the native git transport protocol.
-- Negotiate the objects that need to be transferrered from the server to the client. This includes receiving the current state of the remote repository 
-- Request the required refs and receive the pack file which contains all the objects that are reachable from the requested refs from the remote server.
-- Create a valid git repository directory and file structure on disk.
-- Store the objects and refs on disk.
-- Populate the working directory with the files and directories that represent the tip of the ref the repository points to (taking into account symlink, permissions etc).
-- Create the index file (staging area) that corresponds to that tip and the files on disk.

-- 2
-- Transport Protocol:
-- local protocol, SSH, native git protocol, HTTP

-- 3
-- Repository data exchange in git happens in multiple phases:

-- 3.0 Paccket Line Format
-- gitâ€™s protocol payload makes extensive use of the so called packet line (or pkt-line as used in the technical documentation) format.
-- A pkt-line is a variable length binary string with the length encoded in the first four bytes of the pkt-line.

-- Create a packet line prefixed with the overall length. Length is 4 byte, hexadecimal, padded with 0

-- Git uses the pkt-line format for a few reasons:

-- Efficiency: The pkt-line format is a binary format, which is more efficient to process than text-based formats. This is important for a version control system like Git, which needs to handle potentially large amounts of data.
-- Flexibility: The pkt-line format is variable-length, which means it can accommodate data of different sizes. This is useful for Git, which needs to handle different types of data, from small metadata to large file contents.
-- Simplicity: The pkt-line format is relatively simple, with the length of the data encoded in the first four bytes. This makes it easy to parse, which is important for a system like Git that is used by many different types of software.
-- Compatibility: The pkt-line format is compatible with both binary and text data, which is important for Git, which needs to handle both types of data.

toHex :: Int -> String
toHex = printf "%x"

-- Helper function to pad a string with zeros to make it 4 characters long

padWithZeros str = printf "%04s" str

-- Function to compute the hexadecimal length of a string, padded with zeros
hexLength :: String -> String
hexLength msg = padWithZeros $ toHex (P.length msg + 4)

-- Function to format the packet line
formatPktLine :: String -> String -> String
formatPktLine len msg = len ++ msg

-- Main function to compute the packet line
pktLine :: String -> String
pktLine msg = formatPktLine (hexLength msg) msg

-- To initiate the ref discovery, the client establishes a TCP socket connection to the server on port 9418 and issues a single command in packet line format.
