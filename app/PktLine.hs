-- Repository data exchange in git happens in multiple phases:

-- 3.0 Paccket Line Format
-- gitâ€™s protocol payload makes extensive use of the so called packet line (or pkt-line as used in the technical documentation) format.
-- A pkt-line is a variable length binary string with the length encoded in the first four bytes of the pkt-line.

-- Create a packet line prefixed with the overall length. Length is 4 byte, hexadecimal, padded with 0

-- Git uses the pkt-line format for a few reasons:

-- Efficiency: The pkt-line format is a binary format, which is more efficient to process than text-based formats. This is important for a version control system like Git, which needs to handle potentially large amounts of data.
-- Flexibility: The pkt-line format is variable-length, which means it can accommodate data of different sizes. This is useful for Git, which needs to handle different types of data, from small metadata to large file contents.
-- Simplicity: The pkt-line format is relatively simple, with the length of the data encoded in the first four bytes. This makes it easy to parse, which is important for a system like Git that is used by many different types of software.
-- Compatibility: The pkt-line format is compatible with both binary and text data, which is important for Git, which needs to handle both types of data.

-- Helper function to convert a number to hexadecimal
